4. Access Nagios Web Interface
Open your web browser and access Nagios web interface via the URL http://ServerIP/nagios. For example:

http://192.0.2.10/nagios
You have successfully installed Nagios Core on your server. To log in, use admin as your username and the password you set during the user account creation step as your password. You can now access the dashboard and begin configuring Nagios.

5. Add Remote Hosts
Now that your Nagios server is configured, it's time to configure a remote host to monitor.

To get started, connect as root over SSH to the host you want to monitor.

Install Prerequisites
To monitor hosts, we need to add them to Nagios. By default, Nagios only monitors localhost (the server it's running on). We're going to add hosts that are part of our network to gain even more control. You will need to use the following instructions on all hosts that you want to monitor.

First, install nagios-plugins and nagios-nrpe-server:

# apt-get install nagios-plugins nagios-nrpe-server
Configure NRPE
Next, open the /etc/nagios/nrpe.cfg file. Replace the value of allowed_hosts with 127.0.0.1,0.0.0.0 replacing the second IP with the IP address of the Nagios server.

We will now open the file /etc/nagios/nrpe.cfg and replace a couple of values.

Replace the value of server_address to the private IP address of the host.

Set allowed_hosts to the private IP address of your Nagios server.

Execute df -h /, copy the output, and put that as the value of command. It indicates your root file system.

Save the file when you are finished.

Now restart NRPE:

service nagios-nrpe-server restart
Add the Host to Nagios
Now that we've configured the host we're going to monitor, we need to switch back to our Nagios server and add the host to it. Open the following file with your favorite editor:

# nano /usr/local/nagios/etc/servers/host.cfg
Use the following block as a template. Replace host with an appropriate name for your remote host, and update the host_name, alias, and address values accordingly.

define host {

        use                             linux-server

        host_name                       yourhost

        alias                           My first Apache server

        address                         1.2.3.4

        max_check_attempts              5

        check_period                    24x7

        notification_interval           30

        notification_period             24x7

}
This will allow you to simply monitor whether the server is up or down. Now reload Nagios:

# service nagios reload
